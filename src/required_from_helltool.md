This is not an exhaustive list of all the requirements Looker's table has on files in helltool.
I started it after I'd begun so I've tried to backfill from memory, but I'm sure it's incomplete.


- number_format
- AppState -- color collection stuff
- I18n.t
- Lexp
- web/color
- web/utils
- a few scss files
- window.location in embed_utils
- Number localization
- conditional formatting
- lots of utils
- lots of types
- Looker icons

- Required packages: assets/core_api, d3-array, d3-scale, d3-scale-chromatic, DOMPurify, jquery
